## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

##Study design and data processing
We will analize a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

###Collection of the raw data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Raw data can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
In order to create the tidy data file you will need to:

    1. Download the run_analysis.R script
    2. Set your working directory to the location of the downloaded script
    3. Source the script from the R console by doing:
        > source(run_analysis)
    4. then call the main function:
        > run _analysis()
    5. the process will output a text file called tidy-dataset.txt
    
For more detail on the analysis script and the functions used, please check the `README.md` file.

###Cleaning of the data
The original raw data is spread among different files.
During the cleaning process the test and train datasets were combined as well as complemented with descriptive values for Activities and measure names.
The original measure names were then translated into something more human readable by aplying a simple find&replace function for some key terms like: **Acc** (Accelerometer), **t** (time), **f** (frequency), ***Mag*** (Magnitude), etc.

It is important to highlight that for the purpose of this exercise only the measures on the mean or standard deviation are chosen and that the final dataset is grouped by Activity and Subject with the mean computed for each measure.

[A complete explanation of the process can be found on the README.md file](README.md)

##Description of the variables in the tidy-dataset.txt file

### Activity
Activities performed by the subjects.
Class: Factor w/ 6 levels
Unique values:
 * LAYING
 * SITTING
 * STANDING
 * WALKING
 * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 * WALKING_UPSTAIRS

### Subject
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
Class: int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

### Measures
The remaining 66 columns are the measures, which are normalized and follow a naming convention described below:

    * [time]: Time domain signals, captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
    * [frequency]: Frequency domain signals, obtained by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some signals.
    * [accelerometer]: Accelerometer sensor of the phone.
    * [gyroscope] Gyroscope sensor of the phone.
    * [body]: Body acceleration, calculated from the time domain signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
    * [gravity]: Gravity acceleration, calculated from the time domain signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
    * [jerk]: Jerk signals. The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain these Jerk signals.
    * [magnitude]: The magnitude of three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
    * [mean()]: Calculated mean.
    * [std()]: Calculated standard deviation.
    * [X/Y/Z]: 3-axial components of the sensors, in X, Y, and Z direction.

Here is the structure of the resultant tidy dataset:
